**Milestone**: Mainnet(1.0.0.0)

| Package          | Version | Link                                                               |

## [0.4.5] - Mar-5-2021

**Milestone**: Hippopotamus(0.10.0.8)

| Package          | Version | Link                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Symbol Bootstrap | v0.4.5  | [symbol-bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/symbol-bootstrap) |

-   Added `privateKeySecurityMode`. It defines which private keys can be encrypted and stored in the `target/addresses.yml`:
    - `ENCRYPT`: All private keys are encrypted and stored in the target's `addresses.yml` file. Bootstrap will require a password to operate.
    - `PROMPT_MAIN`: Main private keys are not stored in the target's `addresses.yml` file. Bootstrap will request the main private key when certificates are generated, or transactions need to be signed by the `link` and `enrolProgram` commands.
    - `PROMPT_MAIN_VOTING`: Main and voting private keys are not stored in the target's `addresses.yml` file. Bootstrap will request the main private key when certificates are generated, or transactions need to be signed by the `link` and `enrolProgram` commands. The voting private key will be requested when generating the voting key file.
    - `PROMPT_ALL`: No private keys are stored in the in the target's `addresses.yml` file. Bootstrap will request the private keys when they are required by the different commands.
-   The `preset.yml` doesn't contain any private key anymore, encrypted or otherwise.
-   Certificates are not re-generated if not needed when running `--upgrade`. In this case, the main account private key is not required and will not be requested with the `PROMPT` security modes.
-   Voting key files are not re-generated if not needed when running `--upgrade`. In this case, the voting account private key is not required and will not be requested with the `PROMPT_ALL` or `PROMPT_MAIN_VOTING` security modes.
-   Public keys can be used in custom presets in addition to encrypted private keys. If public keys are used, Bootstrap will prompt for the private keys when required.
-   Added `encrypt` and `decrypt` commands to encrypt custom presets and decrypt generated `target/addresses.yml` files:
-   The `--upgrade` param can be used to change the server keys without dropping the data.
-   Splitting `userconfig` into `server-config` and `broker-config` for each service. 
-   Fixed recovery process.

-   **New Service:** `Faucet`. Bootstrap private network starts a Faucet service in [http://localhost:100/](http://localhost:100/) when using `--assembly full`.
