Symbol Bootstrap | v0.2.0 | [symbol-bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/symbol-bootstrap)

- **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Target folder structure has been changed for scalability. The old target folder needs to be dropped when running this version. Backup the target folder if you need to keep your data!
- **New Command:** `symbol-bootstrap resetData` cleans the peer data and database without dropping the generated configuration.
- **New Command:** `symbol-bootstrap healthCheck` tests if the docker compose network is running locally. `--healthCheck` param is allowed in `start` and `run` commands.
- Allowed `repeat` on a node, a database or a gateway to instantiate them multiple times. This enables you to create large network configurations quickly.
- Allowed `repeat` in the nemesis block's mosaic list. Harvest currency can be removed with `repeat:0`.
- Removed preset `light`. Now it's an assembly for the bootstrap preset: `symbol-bootstrap -p bootstrap -a light`.
- Sink addresses are generated by default.
- Path properties are now relative folder locations. This improves reusability of the configuration when running the services outside docker compose.
- Added node type based default configuration simplifying the configuration of nodes in presets.
- Preset attribute `excludeDockerService: true` allows removing a service from docker-compose. 
- Configurable `trustedHosts` and `localNetworks` in config.
- Simplified mounted volumes in compose.
- Allowed multiple databases in compose.
- Compose's `openPort` now accepts port number.
