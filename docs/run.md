USAGE
  $ symbol-bootstrap run

OPTIONS
  -b, --build
      If provided, docker-compose will run with -b (--build)

  -d, --detached
      If provided, docker-compose will run with -d (--detached) and this command will wait unit server is running before

  --healthCheck
      It checks if the services created with docker compose are up and running.

      This command checks:
      - Whether the docker containers are running.
      - Whether the services' exposed ports are listening.
      - Whether the rest gateways' /node/health are OK.

      The health check process handles 'repeat' and custom 'openPort' services.
