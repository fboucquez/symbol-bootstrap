# Custom presets

It's the way you can tune the network without modifying the code. It's a yml file (`--customPreset` param) that could override some or all properties in the out-of-the-box presets.

Most people would use the out-of-box preset or tune a few attributes.

The file is a hierarchical yaml object. If an attribute is defined at root level, it overrides the default value for all the affected configurations.

The attribute can also be defined in a lower level object just affecting one component (node, gateway, nemesis, etc).

The best way to validate your configuration is by inspecting the generated configuration and preset.yml files in the target folder

**If you are trying new configurations, remember to reset the previous one by running --reset (-r) or by removing the selected target folder (./target by default)**
 
## Examples

### Custom Rest image and throttling

```yaml
symbolRestImage: symbolplatform/symbol-rest:2.3.2
throttlingBurst: 35
throttlingRate: 1000
```

### Custom block duration, max namespace duration and number of nemesis accounts

```yaml
blockGenerationTargetTime: 5s
maxNamespaceDuration: 10d
nemesis:
    mosaics:
        - accounts: 20
```

### Zero fee nodes

```yaml
minFeeMultiplier: 0
```

### Not exposed rest gateway

```yaml
gateways:
    - openPort: false
```

### Custom nodes' friendly names and hosts

Updating first node (single node presets like `testnet`):

```yaml
nodes:
    - friendlyName: My node custom friendly name
      host: 'myNode.custom.hostname'
```

Updating multiple nodes (multi-node presets like `bootstrap`)

```yaml
nodes:
    - friendlyName: Peer Node 1 custom friendly name
    - friendlyName: Peer Node 2 custom friendly name
      host: 'peer2.custom.hostname'
    - friendlyName: Api Node 1 custom friendly name
      host: 'api1.custom.hostname'
```

### Custom generation hash seed, balances and block 1 transactions

```yaml
nemesisGenerationHashSeed: 7391E2EF993C70D2F52691A54411DA3BD1F77CF6D47B8C8D8832C890069AAAAA
nemesis:
    balances:
        TDN2CNADENSTASFK6SCB7MFQLAYNZB3JBZCBLLA: 898300000
        TBK7C5SI3NR3ZEZTMNXRISY6FENDK3YDE63HK7Q: 98800000
        TA45K3WZYQQKSFHJ3DSEQTOO6N7RMBQUVE7H6MA: 984750000
transactions:
    '16963_581474': A1000000000000...(serialized hex transaction)
    '16963_580690': A1000000000000...
    'MyTransaction': 01000000000000...
```

### Use main account as the harvester account.

For security reasons, Bootstrap doesn't use the main account as the harvester account by default. Instead, Bootstrap generates a remote account that would need to be linked to the main account. 
Like with VRF and Voting keys, the linking (`AccountKeyLinkTransaction`) process is included in the nemesis block for new networks or can be issued via the `link` command for nodes connected to existing networks. 

Both main and remote accounts will be reported in the `addresses.yml` file

If you want to use your main account as the harvesting account, you can disable this feature with the following preset:

```yaml
nodeUseRemoteAccount: false
```
**Warning:** Disabling the remote account is not recommended as it exposes your main account's private key in the node's configuration files.

### Enable voting mode in a node

```yaml
nodes:
    - voting: true
```

In order to finalize the peer or voting nodes registration to an existing network like Testnet, be sure your nodes' signing addresses have enough funds. For test environments, you can use the network's faucet.

Then run:

```
symbol-bootstrap link
```

**Note:** Full network `-p bootstrap` nodes are fully configured voting and peer nodes. `VotingKeyLinkTransaction` and `VrfKeyLinkTransaction` are added to the nemesis block automatically.

### Disable voting mode in all bootstrap nodes

```yaml
nodes:
    - voting: false
    - voting: false
```

### Add docker-compose properties to services

Fields added in `compose` object inside the different services like `databases`, `nodes`, etc will be added to the generated docker-compose's services

A custom preset like:

```yaml
nodes:
    - compose:
          cpu_count: 4
          shm_size: 64M
          deploy:
              resources:
                  limits:
                      memory: 4G
```

will generate a docker service like:

```yaml
  peer-node-0:
        container_name: peer-node-0
        image: 'symbolplatform/symbol-server:gcc-10-1.0.1.0'
        .......
        cpu_count: 4
        shm_size: 64M
        deploy:
            resources:
                limits:
                    memory: 4G
```

### Repeat components

```yaml
# custom repeat preset for bootstrap preset.
databases:
    - repeat: 4
nodes:
    - repeat: 3
      name: 'my-custom-peer-node-{{$index}}'
    - repeat: 4
      name: 'my-custom-api-node-{{$index}}'
      friendlyName: 'my-custom-{{$index}}-friendly-name'
gateways:
    - repeat: 4
      apiNodeName: 'my-custom-api-node-{{$index}}'
      ipv4_address: '172.20.0.{{add $index 20}}',
```

`Repeat` is a pretty powerful customization. It tells bootstrap to "repeat" the defined configuration a number of times. This will allow you to generate as many services as you want quickly.

This is specially useful for:

-   Configure a really large network. The generated configuration could be then deployed into different cloud services.
-   Load test many services together to validate how they behave.
-   Exclude a service via `repeat: 0`.

If repeat is active, each value in the object is a [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html) template. `$index` is the index of the generated service starting from 0. 

Given an `$index` of 10:
- `my-custom-peer-node-{{$index}}` will become `my-custom-peer-node-10`
- `172.20.0.{{add $index 20}}` will become `172.20.0.30`

The default preset `bootstrap` uses repeat but with just 1 database, 2 peers, 1 api and 1 rest gateway.


### Disable a service

It's possible `remove` a service from an out-of-the-box preset. You can achieve that at different levels. In this case, I would like to remove the rest `gateways:`. The same idea applies to `databases:` and `nodes:` preset services.

**Exclude the configuration generation and docker service from compose**

```yaml
gateways:
 - repeat: 0
```

**Create the configuration but exclude the service from compose**

```yaml
gateways:
 - excludeDockerService: true
```

**Create the configuration, docker compose service, and run the service but exclude localhost port from opening**

```yaml
gateways:
 - openPort: false
```

**Create the configuration and docker compose service but exclude the service from running**

This is done by passing [docker-compose up](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up) params through bootstrap via `--args`.

```
symbol-bootstrap start -r --args "--scale rest-gateway-0=0"
```

### Enable compose debug mode

It adds debug attributes to the docker compose services. The attributes are:

```
security_opt:
    - 'seccomp:unconfined'
cap_add:
    - ALL
privileged: true 
```

By default, debug mode is disabled. You can enable debug mode in each service.

````
gateways:
    - dockerComposeDebugMode: true # debug mode in gateway
nodes:
    - dockerComposeDebugMode: true # debug mode in node
      brokerDockerComposeDebugMode: true # debug mode in broker
````

Alternatively, you can enable debug mode for all the services, but then disable them by one by. 


````
dockerComposeDebugMode: true # adds debug mode attributes to all the services
databases:
    - dockerComposeDebugMode: false # excluding the database
nodes:
    - brokerDockerComposeDebugMode: false # excluding the broker
````


## Private Keys and Security 

The following sections describe the different ways you can protect your nodes' keys. 

### Specify the Nodes' Private Keys.

If you know the private keys of your node, you can provide them in a custom preset:

#### **`plain-custom-preset.yml`**

```yaml
nodes:
    - voting: true
      mainPrivateKey: CA82E7ADAF7AB729A5462A1BD5AA78632390634904A64EB1BB22295E2E1A1BDD
      transportPrivateKey: 6154154096354BC3DB522174ACD8BFE553893A0991BD5D105599846F17A3383B
      remotePrivateKey: E27AD508907524E2143EF2A3A272DDBEE7558B92550ABA5B82AD65D66B57BD00
      vrfPrivateKey: F3C24C153783B683E40FB2671493B54480370BF4E3AB8027D4BF1293E14EB9B8
```

Usage examples:

-   Rebuild one of your Testnet/Main nodes.
-   Create a new node from migrated opted in accounts.

If your custom preset contains private keys, it's highly recommended to `encrypt` it and provide `--password` when starting or configuring the node with Bootstrap.

Note: Voting keys are ephemeral. They cannot be provided, bootstrap will always generate a new one when resetting the configuration. Bootstrap will only store the public key of the voting key for reference and linking.
If the voting key file in the target folder is lost, bootstrap will generate a new voting key file from a new random key, and you will need to relink it to your main account (`link` command).

```
symbol-bootstrap encrypt --password 1234 --source plain-custom-preset.yml --destination encrypted-custom-preset.yml
rm plain-custom-preset.yml
symbol-bootstrap start --password 1234 --preset testnet --assembly dual --customPreset encrypted-custom-preset.yml
```

Remember to always keep your custom preset, the target's `addresses.yml`, and `preset.yml` privately!

### Specify the Nodes' Public Keys.

In addition to the above, you can provide the accounts public keys instead of the private keys in your custom preset.
This adds a level of security as the private keys aren't present in the custom preset. 
Bootstrap will request them when performing the different operations requiring user intervention when running the commands.

Example:

#### **`plain-custom-preset.yml`**

```yaml
nodes:
    - voting: true
      mainPublicKey: 93F9D99300DD04B66E727CA72667E5A2F6549A28AB8676B69ECAF30455C332E6
      transportPublicKey: C9767496987222790518114049299DD52114BF2A8F7E5F4B70BB2B6365FAFD34
      remotePublicKey: 2350F44F043DB9290390C59F1E1C2F06FCC1675E8B5F4CBDC00DD9DF4428E8FE
      vrfPublicKey: 7834C8AAEFB09402DA32B22768D7CF9DCAC78A7774392E4452F07DDF776E088D
```

In this case, this custom preset does not need to be encrypted as it doesn't contain any private information. Bootstrap will prompt for all private keys.

```
symbol-bootstrap start --preset testnet --assembly dual --customPreset plain-custom-preset.yml
```

**Hint:**

You can mix private and public keys in your custom presets. Remember to encrypt the file when private keys are provided!

### Private Key Security Mode.

By default, Bootstrap encrypts and stores Private Keys in the `./target/addresses.yml` file. This allows Bootstrap to perform the different operations by just asking for a password.

It may be required that the Node cannot store the Main or any Private Key, even in encrypted form. 

If this is you case, you can tell Bootstrap to not store these keys with the `privateKeySecurityMode` preset property. 

The `privateKeySecurityMode` defines which Private Keys can be encrypted and stored in the `target/addresses.yml`:
-   `ENCRYPT`: All private Keys are encrypted and stored in the target's `addresses.yml` file. Bootstrap will have them to be used when required. This is Bootstrap's default behaviour.
-   `PROMPT_MAIN`: Main Private Keys are not stored in the target's `addresses.yml` file. Bootstrap will prompt for the Main Private Key when generating certificates, or transactions need to be signed in the `link` and `enrolProgram` commands.
-   `PROMPT_MAIN_TRANSPORT`: Main and transport private keys are not stored in the target's `addresses.yml` file. Bootstrap will request the main private key when certificates are generated, or transactions need to be signed by the `link` commands.
-   `PROMPT_ALL`: No Private Key is stored in the target's `addresses.yml` file. Bootstrap will prompt for the Private Keys when they are required in the different commands.

When using the `PROMPT` security modes Bootstrap may ask for private keys when running the different commands. This may not be suitable for automatic scripting.

Bootstrap will reject `PROMPT` security modes when an account is being randomly generated. Otherwise, the generated account wouldn't be stored anywhere.

**NOTE:** It is important that the main account's private key is protected, either with a password (`ENCRYPT`) or by not storing it at all (`PROMPT_MAIN`). `PROMPT_ALL` is not so critical as the VRF, voting and remote keys are not as dangerous and they are stored in the server configuration files anyway.

### Never stored Main Private Key.

A useful combination is enabling `PROMPT_MAIN`, which stores the main account public key in the preset, but encrypts the rest of the private keys. 

#### **`plain-custom-preset.yml`**

```yaml
privateKeySecurityMode: PROMPT_MAIN
nodes:
    - voting: true
      mainPublicKey: 93F9D99300DD04B66E727CA72667E5A2F6549A28AB8676B69ECAF30455C332E6
      transportPrivateKey: 6154154096354BC3DB522174ACD8BFE553893A0991BD5D105599846F17A3383B
      remotePrivateKey: E27AD508907524E2143EF2A3A272DDBEE7558B92550ABA5B82AD65D66B57BD00
      vrfPrivateKey: F3C24C153783B683E40FB2671493B54480370BF4E3AB8027D4BF1293E14EB9B8
```

```
symbol-bootstrap encrypt --source plain-custom-preset.yml --destination encrypted-custom-preset.yml
> password promt
rm plain-custom-preset.yml
symbol-bootstrap start --preset testnet --assembly dual --customPreset encrypted-custom-preset.yml
> password prompt
> main account private key prompt
```

In this case, Bootstrap will ask for the main account private key when creating the configuration or running the node for the first time but not when using `--upgrade`.

If the main account is a single account, Bootstrap will ask for the main account private key when signing and announcing transactions using the `link` and `enrolProgram` commands. 
If the main account is multisig, Bootstrap will ask for the cosigner(s) private key(s) to announce the transactions.

### Specify the Network's keys.

If you want to replicate the nemesis block and generation hash of your private bootstrap network, you can specify the nemesis keys:

```yaml
nemesisGenerationHashSeed: 6C1B92391CCB41C96478471C2634C111D9E989DECD66130C0430B5B8D20117CD
nemesis:
  nemesisSignerPrivateKey: B2AF9675B7AA8CCCBB3C1072256B3DF7354223FB5C490FFBDDB1C60696E25219
```

Usage examples:
- Rebuild a network with the same previous configuration.
- Replicate integration tests that may use specific values.

Keep the generated `addresses.yml` and `preset.yml` in the target folder privately!

## Services assembly

When running a `services` assembly with a Faucet, Explorer and HttpProxy, you need to provide the following custom preset:
```yaml
domain: my.domain.com   #Your domain, faucet.my.domain.com and explorer.my.domain.com would need to be registered. 
faucetPrivateKey: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA # The symbol account private key where the Faucet can transfer the tokens from.
```
