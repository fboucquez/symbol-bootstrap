# Why this tool?

This tool has been created to address the problems defined in Symbol's [NIP11](https://github.com/nemtech/NIP/blob/main/NIPs/nip-0011.md).

It replaces:

-   [catapult-service-bootstrap](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-service-bootstrap)
-   [symbol-testnet-bootstrap](https://github.com/nemgrouplimited/symbol-service-bootstrap)

# Key benefits:

-   It's an installable cli tool. It's not a repo you need to clone and compile.
-   The configuration is parametrized via CLI commands and presets instead of by changing properties files.
-   The tools code is unique for any type of network, new networks or nodes in a network. It doesn't need to be copied and pasted in different projects or assemblies.
-   The config command runs on the host machine, not via docker making it easier to debug or tune
-   It's uses the TS SDK for key generation, vrf transactions, address generation instead of using catapult-tools (nemgen is still used to generate the nemesis block).
-   Easier to maintain, the properties files are reused for all nodes, assemblies and network types.
-   Network setup (how many database, nodes, rest gateways to run) is defined in presets, users can provide their own ones.
-   Docker-compose yaml files are generated based on the network setup/preset instead of being manually created/upgraded.
-   The created network (config, nemesis and docker-compose) can be zipped and distributed for other host machines to run it.
-   The used docker images versions can be changed via configuration/preset
-   It uses the [oclif](https://oclif.io) framework. New commands are easy to add and document.
-   It can be included as a npm dependency for clients' e2e testing.

# Concepts

## Preset:

Yaml files that define the configuration and layout of the network and nodes. It defines how many nodes, database, rest gateways, the modes, keys, etc.

Presets are defined at 4 levels from general to specific:

-   Shared: Default configurations for all the networks.
-   Network: It defines the main preset of a given network, example: `bootstrap` or `testnet`.
-   Assembly: It defines a modification of a network, example: `testnet peer`, `tesnet dual`, `testnet api`. Assembly is required for some networks (like `testnet`).
-   Custom: A user provided yml file (`--customPreset` param) that could override some or all properties in the out-of-the-box presets.

Properties in each file override the previous values (by object deep merge).

### Out-of-the-box presets:

-   `-p bootstrap`: Default [preset](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/bootstrap/network.yml). It's a private network with 1 mongo database, 2 peers, 1 api and 1 rest gateway. Nemesis block is generated.
-   `-p bootstrap -a light`: A [light](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/bootstrap/assembly-light.yml) network. It's a version of bootstrap preset with 1 mongo database, 1 dual peer and 1 rest gateway. Great for faster light e2e automatic testing. Nemesis block is generated.
-   `-p bootstrap -a full`: A [full](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/bootstrap/assembly-full.yml) network. The default bootstrap preset plus 1 wallet, 1 explorer and 1 faucet. Great for demonstration purposes. Nemesis block is generated.
-   `-p testnet -a peer`: A [harvesting](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/testnet/assembly-peer.yml) peer node that connects to the current public [testnet](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/testnet/network.yml). [Nemesis block](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-bootstrap/tree/main/presets/testnet/seed/00000) is copied over.
-   `-p testnet -a api`: A [api](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/testnet/assembly-api.yml) peer node that connects to the current public [testnet](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/testnet/network.yml) running its own mongo database and rest gateway. [Nemesis block](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-bootstrap/tree/main/presets/testnet/seed/00000) is copied over.
-   `-p testnet -a dual`: A [dual](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/testnet/assembly-dual.yml) haversting peer node that connects to the current public [testnet](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/testnet/network.yml) running its own mongo database and rest gateway. [Nemesis block](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-bootstrap/tree/main/presets/testnet/seed/00000) is copied over.

### Custom preset:

It's the way you can tune the network without modifying the code. It's a yml file (`--customPreset` param) that could override some or all properties in the out-of-the-box presets.

Custom presets give Symbol Bootstrap its versatility. Check out the custom preset [guides](docs/presetGuides.md)!

## Target:

The folder where the generated config, docker files and data are stored. The folder structure is:

-   `./preset.yml`: the final generated preset.yml that it's used to configure bootstrap, the nodes, docker, etc.
-   `./addresses.yml`: randomly generated data that wasn't provided in the preset. e.g.: SSL keys, nodes' keys, nemesis accounts, generation hash seed, etc.
-   `./nodes`: it holds the configuration, data and logs for all the defined node instances.
-   `./gateways`: it holds the configuration and logs for all the defined node rest gateways.
-   `./nemesis`: The folder used to hold the nemesis block. Block 1 data is generated via `nemgen` tool for new networks. For existing network, it is copied over.
-   `./databases`: the location where the mongo data is stored for the different database instances.
-   `./docker`: the generated docker-compose.yml, mongo init scripts and server basic bash scripts. 
-   `./reports`: the location of the generated reports.

# Requirements

-   Node 10+
-   Docker
-   Docker Compose

Validate your environment by running:

```
node -v
docker -v
docker-compose -v
```

Check your user can run docker without sudo:

```
docker run hello-world
```

If you see an error like:

```
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```

Please follow this [guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-fix-docker-got-permission-denied-while-trying-to-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-socket).

# Usage

It's recommended to run the commands from en empty working dir.

The network configuration, data and docker files will be created inside the target folder ('./target') by default.

```
mkdir my-networks
cd my-networks
```

Once in the working dir:

<!-- usage -->
```sh-session
$ npm install -g symbol-bootstrap
$ symbol-bootstrap COMMAND
running command...
$ symbol-bootstrap (-v|--version|version)
symbol-bootstrap/0.4.0 linux-x64 node-v10.23.1
$ symbol-bootstrap --help [COMMAND]
USAGE
  $ symbol-bootstrap COMMAND
...
```
<!-- usagestop -->

The general usage would be:

```
symbol-bootstrap config -p bootstrap
symbol-bootstrap compose
symbol-bootstrap run
```

You can aggregate all these commands with this one liner:

```
symbol-bootstrap start -p bootstrap
```

If you need to start fresh, you many need to sudo remove the target folder (docker volumes dirs may be created using sudo). Example:

```
sudo rm -rf ./target
```

# E2E Testing support

One use case of this CLI is client E2E testing support. If you are coding a Symbol client, you (Travis or Jenkins) can run e2e tests like:

```
symbol-bootstrap start -p bootstrap --detached
YOUR TEST (e.g: npm run test, gradle test, selenium etc.)
symbol-bootstrap stop
```

`--detached` starts the server waiting until it is up (by polling the network http://localhost:3000/node/health). The command will fail if the components are not up in 30 seconds.

You can also provide your own custom preset (`-c`) if you want your e2e test to start with a specific state (specific balances addresses, mosaics, namespaces, generation hash seed, etc.)

## Node client E2E via CLI:

The CLI can also be used as npm project (dev) dependency (`npm install --save-dev symbol-bootstrap`). Then you can integrate the network to your npm test cycle.
Your `package.json` can look like this:

```yaml

"devDependencies": {
    ....
    "symbol-bootstrap": "0.0.x",
    ....
}

scripts": {
...
    "clean-network": "symbol-bootstrap clean",
    "run-network": "symbol-bootstrap start -c ./output/my_custom_preset.yml --detached --healthCheck",
    "run-stop": "symbol-bootstrap stop",
    "integration-test": "....some mocha/jest/etc tests running against localhost:3000 network....",
    "e2e": "npm run clean-network && npm run run-network && npm run integration-test && npm run stop-network",
...
}
```

Then, you, Jenkins, Travis or your CI tool can run;

```
npm run e2e
```

## Node client E2E via API:

Alternatively, you can use the [BootstrapService](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-bootstrap/blob/main/src/service/BootstrapService.ts) facade to programmatically start and stop a server.

Example:

```ts
import {BootstrapService, StartParams, Preset} from 'symbol-bootstrap'; 
import {expect} from '@oclif/test'; 

it('Bootstrap e2e test', async () => {
    const service = new BootstrapService();
    const config: StartParams = {
        preset: Preset.bootstrap,
        reset: true,
        healthCheck: true,
        timeout: 60000 * 5,
        target: 'target/bootstrap-test',
        detached: true,
        user: 'current',
    };
    try {
        await service.stop(config);
        const configResult = await service.start(config);
        expect(configResult.presetData).not.null;
        expect(configResult.addresses).not.null;
        // Here you can write unit tests against a http://localhost:3000 network
    } finally {
        await service.stop(config);
    }
});
```

It's recommended to reuse the same server for multiple tests by using `beforeAll`, `afterAll` kind of statements.

# Development

If you want to contribute to this tool, clone this repo and run:

```
npm install -g
```

Then, `symbol-bootstrap` runs from the source code. You can now try your features after changing the code.

Pull Requests are appreciated! Please follow the contributing [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Note: cloning this repo is only for people that want to tune the tool in a way it cannot be configured. If this is your case, please provide a feature request.
General users should install this tool like any other node module.

# Commands

<!-- commands -->
# Command Topics

* [`symbol-bootstrap clean`](docs/clean.md) - It removes the target folder deleting the generated configuration and data
* [`symbol-bootstrap compose`](docs/compose.md) - It generates the `docker-compose.yml` file from the configured network.
* [`symbol-bootstrap config`](docs/config.md) - Command used to set up the configuration files and the nemesis block for the current network
* [`symbol-bootstrap healthCheck`](docs/healthCheck.md) - It checks if the services created with docker compose are up and running.
* [`symbol-bootstrap help`](docs/help.md) - display help for symbol-bootstrap
* [`symbol-bootstrap link`](docs/link.md) - It announces VRF and Voting Link transactions to the network for each node with 'Peer' or 'Voting' roles. This command finalizes the node registration to an existing network.
* [`symbol-bootstrap report`](docs/report.md) - it generates reStructuredText (.rst) reports describing the configuration of each node.
* [`symbol-bootstrap resetData`](docs/resetData.md) - It removes the data keeping the generated configuration, certificates, keys and block 1.
* [`symbol-bootstrap run`](docs/run.md) - It boots the network via docker using the generated `docker-compose.yml` file and configuration. The config and compose methods/commands need to be called before this method. This is just a wrapper for the `docker-compose up` bash call.
* [`symbol-bootstrap start`](docs/start.md) - Single command that aggregates config, compose and run in one line!
* [`symbol-bootstrap stop`](docs/stop.md) - It stops the docker-compose network if running (symbol-bootstrap started with --detached). This is just a wrapper for the `docker-compose down` bash call.
* [`symbol-bootstrap supernode`](docs/supernode.md) - It registers the nodes in the supernode rewards program by announcing the enrol transaction to the registration address.
