# Why this library?

To handle dozens or hundreds of Symbol Nodes in "cattle" style, where nodes are created and managed in bundles. It's the core library of the [symbol-network](../network-cli) cli.

If you are creating a Symbol node for the first time, please have look at the [symbol-bootstrap](../bootstrap-cli) cli.

For regular usage or if you are creating a Symbol Network for the first time, please try the [symbol-network](../network-cli) cli.

You can import this library if you want to create a custom Javascript/Typescript tool to manage networks.
